Plant diseases affect millions of crops globally, posing significant challenges to agricultural productivity and food security.
In India 70% of population depends on agriculture and contribute 17% towards the GDP of country
Traditional visual inspection by agricultural professionals can be subjective and prone to errors, necessitating more reliable diagnostic tools.
Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) offer promising solutions for automated and accurate plant disease detection.
AI-based plant disease detection systems aim to assist farmers and agribusinesses in diagnosing plant diseases through image classification, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of agricultural diagnostics.
CNN model demonstrated strong performance with high training and validation accuracy, indicating effective learning and generalization capabilities for plant disease detection.
The model was trained and evaluated on a diverse set of 38 plant disease classes, showcasing its ability to handle a wide range of diseases and healthy plant conditions.
The multiple convolutional layers and max-pooling operations effectively extracted significant features from the plant images, aiding in accurate disease classification.
